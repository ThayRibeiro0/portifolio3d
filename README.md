## Description

This project has as purpose share my knowledge an abilities as student of System Development where is work various funcionalities to practice and improve. 

Used libraries: emailjs/browser, react-three/drei, react-three/fiber, bootstrap, drei, framer-motion, maath, react, react-dom, react-router-dom, react-three-fiber, react-tilt, three, react-vertical-timeline-component, types/react, types/react-dom, vitejs/plugin-react, autoprefixer, postcss, tailwindcss, vite and node_modules with a lot of dependences.

It is possible see in the homepage the navbar with one icon in the left and sections to other pages in the right, one object in 3D, with what the user can interact, a short presentation about me and one button to pass to about page. The About page bring my journey in programming and compliment with links of Github and Linkedln that have more informations and projects that I acted before. The work experience page it is one space open to my future work experiences already I have only academics experiences and the same page have some of my skills also in 3D. The project page bring same projects that I worked before to practice code. The testimonials is the declaration of people that worked with me about who I am in a job. And finally the contact open space to call me to talk and leave same message.

## Instalation

The things that you need to run to see the portifolio it is [npm install] and [npm run dev] and of course you need to have and if do not have you need to install the package of Node to run the React.

```bash
  npm install
  npm run dev
```
    
## What each of the files you wrote for the project contains and does?

The project use the vite, tailwindcss, node_modules,gitignore, javascript.jsx and javascript.js, react, three.js, html, css and installation, netlify to host the page; The Vite.js is a lightweight and fast JavaScript framework that is primarily used for building web applications with highly efficient and productive development experience, facilite the construction of web server and it is possible see the project run [npm run dev]. The Tailwindcss is a popular utility-first CSS framework that quickly build and style user interfaces for web projects, provides a set of pre-defined CSS class that can be use to style the HTML. The node_modules directory is a folder commonly found in Node.js projects that it is automatically created when you use package managers like npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn to install dependencies for your Node.js project run. The gitignore file is a configuration file used by Git, a version control system, to determine which files and directories should be ignored and not tracked by Git. Javascript.jsx and Javascript.js have differences and one then is the former indicates the presence of JSX syntax, primarily used in React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, or similar libraries, while the latter denotes regular JavaScript code without JSX. JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. React is a Javascript-based UI development library widely used in web development. Three.js is a Javascript-based WebGL engine, one library, that can run GPU-powered games and other graphics-powered apps straight from the browser and provides many features and APIs for drawing 3D scenes in your browser. Html(Hypertect Markup Language) is a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web(www) pages. Css is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. Netlify is a remote-first cloud computing company that offer a development platform thta includes build, deploy and serveless backend services for web applications and dynamic websites. This way it was possible explain what the projects contains and does in summary.
